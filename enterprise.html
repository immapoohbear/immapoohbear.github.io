    <h2>Server Virtualisation</h2>
    <div class="two-rows">
      <div class="two-columns">
        <img src="images/image-0003.jpg">
      </div>
      <div class="two-columns">
        <p>Server technology is evolving rapidly but the information processing requirements in
          every organization is growing even faster. In this scenario Virtualisation is an exciting
          business prospect. Not only does it provide substantially lower operational costs and
          increased business agility, there is also no danger of compromising your security and
          business operations</p>
        <p>
          We aim to make virtualization as easy as possible to understand, design and deploy.
          Here, in a nutshell, is what we could do for you.
          Server virtualization can dramatically reduce the number of physical servers in your
          business. This is done by enabling multiple “virtual servers” to be run on a single, or
          reduced, number of machines. Each virtual server has its own operating system and
          applications are run with users having access via the network as normal. These multiple virtual
          servers are managed via a single management layer, or “hypervisor”.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Storage Virtualization</h2>
    <p>With storage virtualisation, storage capacity is completely removed from the individual
      user or server. Instead, it is deployed in a single or shared pool. Storage capacity is
      allocated to, and accessed by, the user or server via the network and can be adjusted to
      meet demand at any given time. Proactively managed by the IT team, disk space can be
      fully utilised without wastage. The result? Capacity planning, data classification by
      importance, backup and restore, and peak-time balancing all become easier.
